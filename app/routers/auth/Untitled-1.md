Overview. In the last months olympus ssm team worked on building one MVP to showcase the posiiblity of moving access management from role based to attribute based.
In this context, one POC which evolved in an MVP was built. 

During Quarter 3 (July–September 2025), the Olympus Team has delivered the following items to the ECB:
 Completed the MVP outside ECB network.
 Completed integrations with IAM and IMAS, and initiated the integration with IGAM, which is currently in progress. 
 The integration purposes is to sync user and organisation data with our internal SMAUG project data source.
 MVP work still in progress, with the scope recently updated.
 MVP Deployment: Migrated the MVP 0.1 — previously running in the local environment — to the ECB AWS architecture, ensuring full compliance with the ECB’s security constraints, best practices, and operational procedures.





Updates of the scope of our team. As of first of October, the scope of the SSM team changed.
We (togheter with another team, TBD) will be responsible for the actual implementation.
In that case we are working now on also building the requirements and consider all the needed requirements for one full scale implementation.
